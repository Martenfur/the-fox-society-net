				This is Monofoxe - a game engine based on Monogame Framework. Its main goal is to greatly simplify
				working with Monogame and to provide a basic set of tools enabling you to just 
				<span class="text-foxe-accent"> create a new project and make a game</span> 
				without removing low-level access to the framework. 
				Monofoxe is extremely extensible and fully compatible with Monogame, which makes it equally great 
				for both small games and big long-term projects.
